        I have honed my software development skills through "Bottega University". My background is largely in operations, but I am currently in school to further my education in full-stack development. I have a strong passion for coding and have acquired skills in HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, Python, MySQL, and Git. I am eager to use my skills to contribute to the tech industry and make a meaningful impact. My ultimate goal is to become a reliable and efficient software engineer who can deliver high-quality products. When I'm not coding, I love immersing myself in the world of fantasy, particularly the works of J.R.R. Tolkien.
